Your first two seconds decide everything. These hook formulas consistently win for consumer brands
running performance spend on TikTok.

## 1. “I almost quit…”

Start with a personal confession. It builds trust fast and frames the product as the turning point.

## 2. “If you have [problem], you need this”

Call out the pain, then jump straight into the solution. Make it specific.

## 3. “POV: you just found…”

This pattern fits native TikTok language and primes viewers for a demo or reveal.

## 4. “I tried this for 7 days”

Time-boxed results feel tangible and reduce skepticism. Show before/after quickly.

## 5. “Stop scrolling if you’re [persona]”

Great for targeting. It filters the right audience and increases engagement.

## 6. “Here’s what no one tells you about…”

Use a myth-buster framing to create curiosity. Then prove the statement with a visual.

## 7. “Watch this before you buy”

This creates urgency for shoppers and positions your ad as the “smart research” step.

## How to test these

Keep your angle, offer, and creative structure the same. Swap only the opening line so you can
attribute performance to the hook itself.

## Key takeaway

The best hooks are short, specific, and personal. Pick three formulas, produce two variations each,
and launch them in a clean test batch. You will know your winner by day two.
