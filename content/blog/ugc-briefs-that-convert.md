Most UGC projects fail before filming even starts. The fix is a tight brief that gives creators
exactly what they need without killing their authenticity.

## The 15-minute brief outline

Use this simple structure for every creator:

1. **Goal**: What action should the viewer take?
2. **Persona**: Who is this for and what do they care about?
3. **Hook options**: Provide 3–5 opening lines.
4. **Must-say lines**: Key claims or phrases you need on camera.
5. **Proof**: Demonstrations, results, or social proof to show.
6. **CTA**: The exact call-to-action you want at the end.

## Example hook options

- “I’ve tried 12 serum brands and this is the only one I kept.”
- “If your skin looks tired on camera, watch this.”
- “Here’s how I fixed dry patches in one week.”

## Creative guardrails that help

- Shoot vertical, close to face, bright natural light.
- Capture B-roll: product, textures, before/after, packaging.
- Keep clips under 10 seconds for fast pacing.

## Key takeaway

Creators move faster when they know exactly what to deliver. Use this outline, and you will receive
footage that is ready to edit into ads without extra back-and-forth.
