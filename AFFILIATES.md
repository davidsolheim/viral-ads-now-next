# Affiliates Program - Dollar to Credit Conversion

## Credit Conversion Rate

**$0.01 USD = 1 Credit** (1 penny = 1 credit)

All purchases and subscriptions are converted to credits at this rate for the purpose of calculating referral rewards.

## Referral Reward Calculation

Affiliates earn **20%** of all purchases made by users they refer.

### How Rewards Are Calculated

1. **Convert dollars to credits**: Multiply the purchase amount by 100 (since $0.01 = 1 credit)
2. **Calculate 20% reward**: Multiply credits by 0.2 (20%)
3. **Award credits**: Credits are added to the referrer's account

### Examples

#### Example 1: Credit Purchase
- Referred user purchases: **$100** worth of credits
- Credits from purchase: $100 × 100 = **10,000 credits**
- Referral reward (20%): 10,000 × 0.2 = **2,000 credits**
- **You earn: 2,000 credits**

#### Example 2: Subscription
- Referred user subscribes: **$50/month** subscription
- Credits from subscription: $50 × 100 = **5,000 credits**
- Referral reward (20%): 5,000 × 0.2 = **1,000 credits**
- **You earn: 1,000 credits per month** (as long as they remain subscribed)

#### Example 3: Multiple Purchases
- Referred user makes 3 purchases: $40, $60, $80
- Purchase 1: $40 × 100 = 4,000 credits → 20% = **800 credits**
- Purchase 2: $60 × 100 = 6,000 credits → 20% = **1,200 credits**
- Purchase 3: $80 × 100 = 8,000 credits → 20% = **1,600 credits**
- **Total earned: 3,600 credits**

## Ongoing Rewards

### Subscriptions
- You earn **20% of every subscription payment** while the referred user maintains an active subscription
- Rewards are processed automatically each billing cycle
- If the subscription is canceled, rewards stop

### Credit Purchases (Token Top-ups)
- You earn **20% of every credit purchase** made by referred users
- This applies to all credit purchases, regardless of subscription status
- Rewards are processed immediately upon purchase

## Important Notes

- **Credits are whole numbers** (no fractional credits)
- Rewards are calculated and awarded automatically
- All rewards are tracked in your referral dashboard
- Credits can be used immediately after being awarded
- Since 1 credit = $0.01, even small purchases result in meaningful rewards
